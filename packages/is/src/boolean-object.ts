/**
 * @module boolean-object
 *
 * Checks if a value is a Boolean object, which is a boxed-primitive boolean
 * that was created either with the `new Boolean()` syntax, or by wrapping
 * a primitive boolean in the `Object()` wrapper function.
 *
 * Boxed primitives are strongly discouraged in JavaScript, as they can lead
 * to all sorts of unexpected behavior and performance issues. As such, this
 * function - and the other boxed primitive functions like it - are provided
 * for your convenience, to help you easily ensure your code is not on the
 * receiving end of such behavior.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { isBooleanObject } from "jsr:@type/is/boolean-object";
 *
 * isBooleanObject(Object(true)); // true
 * isBooleanObject(new Boolean(true)); // true
 *
 * isBooleanObject(Boolean(true)); // false
 * isBooleanObject(true); // false
 * ```
