 *
 * It's also more strict than `instanceof` operations, only recognizing an
 * object as a `Set` instance if it was created with a valid construct
 * operation of either the `Set` constructor or a subclass of it. As such,
 * `Object.create(Set.prototype)` and similar avenues will return `false`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { isSet } from "jsr:@type/is/set";
 *
 * isSet(new Set()); // true
 * isSet(new WeakSet()); // false
 * isSet(new Map()); // false
 * isSet([]); // false
 * isSet(Object.create(Set.prototype)); // false
