/**
 * @module bigint-object
 *
 * Checks if a value is a BigInt object, which is a boxed-primitive BigInt
 * that was created by wrapping a primitive BigInt (bigint) in the `Object()`
 * wrapper function.
 *
 * Boxed primitives are strongly discouraged in JavaScript, as they can lead
 * to all sorts of unexpected behavior and performance issues. As such, this
 * function - and the other boxed primitive functions like it - are provided
 * for your convenience, to help you easily ensure your code is not on the
 * receiving end of such behavior.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { isBigIntObject } from "jsr:@type/is/bigint-object";
 *
 * isBigIntObject(Object(BigInt("2"))); // true
 *
 * isBigIntObject(BigInt("2")); // false
 * isBigIntObject(2n); // false
 * ```
