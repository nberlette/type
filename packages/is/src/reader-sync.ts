  /** Reads up to `p.byteLength` bytes into `p`. It resolves to the number of
   * bytes read (`0` < `n` <= `p.byteLength`) and rejects if any error
   * encountered. Even if `readSync()` returns `n` < `p.byteLength`, it may
   * use all of `p` as scratch space during the call. If some data is

   * returns what is available instead of waiting for more.

   * When `readSync()` encounters end-of-file condition, it returns EOF
   * (`null`).
   *
   * When `readSync()` encounters an error, it throws with an error.
   *
   * Callers should always process the `n` > `0` bytes returned before
   * considering the EOF (`null`). Doing so correctly handles I/O errors that
   * happen after reading some bytes and also both of the allowed EOF
   * behaviors.
   *
   * Implementations should not retain a reference to `p`.
